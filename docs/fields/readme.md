Each setting type has an associated class, each with its own and shared properties/methods (setter and getters)

> Most of the time, you will not need to call the getters, but they are documented just incase.

## Field Types

* [Text `<input type="text">`](text.md)
* [Number `<input type="number">`](text.md)
* [Select](text.md)
* [Checkbox (Single)](text.md)
* [Checkbox (Group)](text.md)

## Shared Traits

* [Placeholder](placeholder.md) - Allows the use of placeholders in \<input> fields
* [Data](data.md) Allows for the use of data attributes in fields (for use in JS)
